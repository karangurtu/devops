# WHAT

Collection of best practices related to DevOps. In time I would like to have more than best practice documented 
but also tools and other related DevOps artificats, e.g., checklists.

# HOW

The best practices are collected in the spirit of [software design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern). After reviews, updates, they are catalog and added to
summary presentation.

# WHEN

The initial set of best practices was collected while working on the [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry)
project. Many come from discussion with the teams at Pivotal and IBM.
